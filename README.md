# Bike-Buyers-Dashboard
Overview

This Excel project focused on analyzing a dataset of bike buyers to uncover patterns and insights related to bike purchases. The project involved cleaning the data, creating pivot tables, and developing an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics such as commute distance, customer age group, and income levels.

Dataset

The dataset included information about bike buyers, covering attributes like marital status, income, age, education, region, and whether they purchased a bike or not.

Data Preparation

Data Cleaning:
Standardized values (e.g., replacing 'M' and 'S' in marital status with 'Married' and 'Single').
Removed duplicates and ensured data consistency.
Created an "Age Bracket" column to categorize customers by age group.

Dashboard Features

Customer Commute Distance vs. Bike Purchases: A line graph showing the relationship between commute distance and bike purchases.
Customer Age Group vs. Bike Purchases: A graph depicting bike purchase behavior across different age groups.
Average Income Per Purchase: A bar chart showing average income per purchase, broken down by gender and purchase status, along with customer count.
Interactive Filters: Filters for Region, Marital Status, and Education to explore specific data segments.

Impact

The dashboard offers valuable insights into the factors influencing bike purchases, helping stakeholders understand customer behavior and make data-driven decisions.
